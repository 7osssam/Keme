# Keme

Keme is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to enhance the tourist experience by providing augmented reality (AR) features for navigation and exploration of museums and other points of interest. The app utilizes the Stardust API to offer a seamless and immersive experience, including AR navigation, OCR translation, and QR code scanning.


## Features

- #### AR Navigation:
 Easily navigate through museums and points of interest using an interactive map overlayed on your device's camera view. The map highlights key exhibits and artifacts and provides real-time directions to guide you to your desired destination.

- #### OCR Translation: 
Translate text labels or descriptions of exhibits and artifacts into your preferred language. The app utilizes your device's camera to scan the text, providing real-time translations using the Google Translate API.

- #### QR Code Scanning: 
Access additional information about exhibits or artifacts by scanning QR codes or barcodes on their labels. Use your device's camera to scan the code, and instantly access historical context, multimedia content, or other related information.
